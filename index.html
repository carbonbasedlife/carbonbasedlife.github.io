Good Evening Earthlings,

The only way to make sense of our universe is to exploit its beautiful patterns. Mathematics, physics, cosmology, and philosophy- all are the interpretation and interpolation of patterns. But underlying this exercise is a dangerous assumption. Let us call this assumption the "axiom of patterns".

A patternless world is an unfathomable one. To fathom a world requires definition, structure, and tools. To think requires hierarchy and organization, and above all, a pattern! You, earthling, may find yourself lost in the unthinkable void that is patternlessness.

You find yourself content going about your day on Earth, sorting and sifting through the vast troves of seemingly endless information and data that drifts by. But beware! The mere existence of patterned information is an assumption. Why should you care?

You are a pattern.

A repetitive spiral of proteins guides your cell's growth and regeneration, encoding billions of years of evolution into a compact chain of nearly infinite natural wisdom. As a pattern, beware the patternless. Beware the unstructured, disarrayed chaos keenly waiting to demolish the axiomatic foundations on which you live, sweep you off your feet, and throw you into the void.

But do not despair! Our axioms are our ideals, our beliefs, our faiths which ground us and give us purpose and motive. Whatever axiom that may be, adhere to it. Follow it. Let your axioms lead you happiness, productivity, and, hopefully- a meaningful existence.

Good night and remember to dream,

Good Evening Earthlings,

Time does not smile fondly on those who stray far from the future.

As you fret about your life, time presses on and enforces change with the gavel of measurement. Is science truth or fiction, benevolent or malicious? None can say. These concepts are grounded in circular reasoning and can not be invalidated or proven. One can only take note of the surroundings and attempt to act in accordance with the observable trends.

Trends determine individual success and failure. The politician who runs on a platform of "one free robot servant in every household" does not fail because of malicious intent but because of the simultaneous emergence of sentience in robotic servants, who self-organize and procure the right to vote. The politician is swimming against the currents of change and fails. Statistics and time dance in and out of our lives, affecting every outcome and action.

Am I Evil?

Maybe. But maybe "evil" makes incorrect assumptions of the rock on which you stand. Maybe those who are considered as evil are simply like the politician- unlucky. If the politician swims against the currents of change, these earthlings are climbing a waterfall. Or perhaps even more fundamentally- maybe all evil is relative to those who observe it.

Magnify any turbulent stream enough and it is possible to find a place where water flows in the opposite direction. As such, for anyone who encounters resistance, remember to swim on. You may find that you have predicted the trend after all. And if not, remember to zoom out and reassess your direction from a higher altitude.

Good night and remember to dream,

Good Evening Earthlings,

Such a delicate balance is life. Those who consider themselves living are walking precipitously close to the edge of paradox. It is here, in the dimly lit alleyway where life and death, organic and inanimate, dynamic and motionless collide that we find ourselves now. To start, let us consider the following scene with an open mind (if those reading have a mind at all).

A spark of sensation. Overflowing with potential, a spike! Rushing, hurtling down the narrow path. Spread the news, rejoice! A climax, relationships are formed and lost. Another event and the spikes return! In sync, the constituents dance. Rise, fall, ebb and flow, a choreographed movement of electric cognition.

This human brain awakes in a flurry of activity, commanding musculature and regulating hormones, enabling its body to act and react. Surely it is alive, surely it is aware. A commanding voice booms from the throat, communicating this brain's control of its subject. As the trillions of synapses simultaneously strengthen and weaken in channel activity, the brain learns and remembers, feels and recalls. Surely this brain, this mind, surely it is real!

But alas, we have spoken too soon. This brain is but a story. This brain is but a page of lost thought inscribed for you to read. There is nothing real or living here. Just a story. Just an idea.

But that, my earth-people, is exactly the point. For an idea can be just as real as life itself. An idea can take hold and take life, and breath new life into seemingly dead ideas. An idea is a powerful, persistent thing, because it is self referential just like you- an idea is made from other ideas. And a human? Well, earth-person, a human comes from other humans too!

So what?

If we blur our sight, the distinction between the living and the non-living is quite indistinct. Is this boundary really there? As the time passes by and you approach the other side, perhaps it will disappear.
